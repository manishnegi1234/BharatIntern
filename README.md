BharatIntern Projects:
Welcome to the BharatIntern repository containing Data Science projects: These projects showcase predictive modeling using carefully curated datasets sourced from Kaggle, and provide a valuable learning resource for those interested in data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

Project Descriptions
1. Stock Prediction
This data science project focuses on predicting stock prices using the power of deep learning and LSTM networks. The project utilizes historical stock price data obtained from Kaggle to build and train an LSTM model that can forecast future stock prices with a high degree of accuracy.

2. Titanic Classification
A machine learning model on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have been survived or not using the passenger data. For this project, classification algorithm like Logistic Regression , accuracy_score and train_test_split to split the data into train/ test to check and avoid overfitting has been used .

Datasets
The datasets used in these projects are well-preprocessed and relevant to the specific problem domains. The data exploration and preprocessing steps are thoroughly documented in the project notebooks, providing valuable insights into the process of transforming raw data into actionable information. The files for datasets are also attached for clearity.

Usage
Each project is contained within its own dedicated directory, complete with Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that walk you through the entire process, from data loading and exploration to model building and evaluation. You can follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebooks to understand the methodologies used and reproduce the analyses on your own machine.

Dependencies
To run the notebooks and experiment with the code, you'll need to have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries and packages. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts. You can install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file in each project directory.

Contributions
Contributions to this repository are more than welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add your own take on the projects, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
